**âš½ Football Match Outcome Prediction with Machine Learning**

ðŸ“Œ **Project Description**

This project aims to predict football match results (home win or away win) using Machine Learning.

Motivation: to demonstrate how data analytics and classification algorithms can be applied in sports, generating useful insights and supporting decisions in contexts such as sports betting, scouting, and performance analysis.

The project includes:

- Preprocessing of historical match data.

- Training and evaluation of models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN, XGBoost, and LightGBM.

- Interactive Streamlit app to easily test the model.
